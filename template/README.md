This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Deploy to AWS Amplify with AWS CloudFormation Action for GitHub Actions

You need your own AWS account to deploy the app to the [AWS Amplify Console](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/console/). Follow these [steps](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/) if you do not have an account.

The AWS CloudFormation stack is deployed via [AWS CloudFormation "Deploy CloudFormation Stack" Action for GitHub Actions](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/aws-cloudformation-deploy-cloudformation-stack-action-for-github-actions).

When you create a new repository from the template, the GitHub Workflow is not setup. To setup the workflow, you need to follow these steps.

1. Create a [new personal token](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) with **full control of private repositories** store it as [encrypted secret](https://help.github.com/en/actions/configuring-and-managing-workflows/creating-and-storing-encrypted-secrets) `AMPLIFY_TOKEN` in the new repository.
2. Create a [new IAM user in your AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) with **Programmatic Access** and store the access key ID as `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and secret access key as `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` as secrets in your new repository.
3. (Optional) Configure a [custom domain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/custom-domains.html) for your app by setting the `AMPLIFY_DOMAIN` secret.

You need to run the ***Manual Deploy*** to deploy it. You find this with *Actions* > *Manual Deploy* > *Run wokflow*.

> The manual triggers is a feature [recently announced](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-07-06-github-actions-manual-triggers-with-workflow_dispatch/) and avoids running the build process both on GitHub Action and AWS Amplify
> The stack is deployed to `us-east-1` by default. Please change it to the region you want to deploy this to.

The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it. In the frontend environments is should show no builds. Click on **Run Build** to initialize the app.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
